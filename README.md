My Dotfiles for my MacOS environments
===

This repository contains stuff to manage settings and apps running on my MacOS environments. This is heavily inspired by [Dries Vints' Dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles). Check out his repository and also [his awesome blog post](https://medium.com/@driesvints/getting-started-with-dotfiles-76bf046d035c) if you are interested in getting started into dotfiles as well!
